      <p>
        R Venkatesha Prasad completed PhD from IISc, Bangalore, India. During PhD research, a scalable VoIP conferencing
        platform was designed. Many new ideas including a conjecture, were formulated and tested by developing an
        application suite based on the research findings. The work involved understanding of network protocols,
        application design and human computer interface. Part of the thesis lead to a startup venture, Esqube
        Communication Solutions, headed by professors from IISc. He was leading a team of up to ten engineers,
        developing many real-time applications including bridging anonymous VoIP calls called Click-to-Talk for portlas.
        While at Esqube, eight patent applications and three PCT applications were filed along with his colleagues.
        Esqube was selected as top 100 IT innovators in India in 2006 by NASSCOM and top 100 in promising companies in
        Asia by RedHerring in 2008. He worked for Esqube from 2006 to 2009 on a part-time basis as a senior design
        consultant. In 2005, he joined TUDelft as a PostDoc to work on the EU FP7 Magnet Project and the Dutch project
        PNP-2008 on Personal Networks (PNs). His work involved evolving PN network architecture and foreign
        communication. The work resulted in an ECMA report. He also started working on Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)
        and 60GHz networks for future homes. He is contributing to IEEE standards on CRNs. Now, his work involves the
        Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber Physical systems (CPS) and energy harvesting networks. He is working on EU
        funded iCore project on IoT. The work at TUDelft resulted in around 200 publications. Currently, he is working
        on IoT/CPS, Tactile Internet, LoRa and has started working on Space Applications with a leading space research
        organization.
        <br><br>
        He holds a “University Teaching Qualification” for all the four Technical universities in the Netherlands with
        excellence for his innovative use of Facebook to teach a course. He has delivered many keynotes and lectures. He
        has supervised 16 PhDs on IoT, Personal Networks, 60GHz and Cognitive radios. He is also contributing to the
        academic community by leading many IEEE activities, such as memberships of standards boards, leading technical
        committees, etc., apart from reviewing and organizing conferences and workshops. He was co-founder and one of
        main organizers of successful International Workshop on Energy Efficiency in Wireless Networks in conjunction
        with IEEE ICC 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. He is General Co-Chair, IEEE ICC 2015 Workshop on Next
        Generation Green ICT. He was Track Chair of Cognitive Radio and Spectrum Sensing of IEEE VTC2013-Spring in
        Dresden, is Symposium Co-Chair for IEEE Globecom-2015. He was Technical Program Chair of IEEE Symposium on
        Communications and Vehicular Technology in the Benelux (SCVT) 2014. He is also a member of IEEE TCCN, AHSNTC,
        TCGCC and TCCC. He has been founding member of TCGCC. He also served as the symposium chair of Track on Green
        Communications and Computing Networks in GC 2016. He is a senior member of IEEE and ACM.

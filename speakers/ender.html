      <p>
        Ender Ayanoglu received the Ph.D. degree from Stanford University, Stanford, CA in 1986, in electrical
        engineering. He was with the Communications Systems Research Laboratory, part of AT&T Bell Laboratories,
        Holmdel, NJ until 1996, and Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies until 1999. From 1999 until 2002, he was a Systems
        Architect at Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA. Since 2002, he has been a Professor in the Department of
        Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, CA, where he served as
        the Director of the Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing and held the Conexant-Broadcom Endowed
        Chair during 2002-2010. His past accomplishments include invention of the 56K modems, characterization of
        wavelength conversion gain in Wavelength Division Multiplexed (WDM) systems, and diversity coding, a technique
        for link failure recovery in communication networks employing erasure coding introduced in 1990, prior to the
        publication of the first papers on network coding. During 2000-2001, he served as the founding chair of the
        IEEE-ISTO Broadband Wireless Internet Forum (BWIF), an industry standards organization which developed and built
        a broadband wireless system employing Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and a Medium Access
        Control (MAC) algorithm that provides Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. This system is the precursor of
        today’s Fourth and Fifth Generation (4G and 5G) cellular wireless systems. 
        <br><br>
        From 1993 until 2014, Dr. Ayanoglu was an Editor, and since January 2014 is a Senior Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Communications. He served
        as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Communications from 2004 to 2008. From January 2015 until
        December 2016 he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications - Series
        on Green Communications and Networking. This series published three special issues with record number of papers.
        He led the efforts to start the IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking and served as its
        Founding Editor-in-Chief from August 2016 to August 2020. From 1990 to 2002, he served on the Executive
        Committee of the IEEE Communications Society Communication Theory Committee, and from 1999 to 2002, was its
        Chair. Dr. Ayanoglu is the recipient of the IEEE Communications Society Stephen O. Rice Prize Paper Award in
        1995, the IEEE Communications Society Best Tutorial Paper Award in 1997, the IEEE Communications Society
        Communication Theory Technical Committee Outstanding Service Award in 2014, and the IEEE Communications Society
        Joseph LoCicero Award for outstanding contributions to IEEE Communications Society Journals as Editor,
        Editor-in-Chief (EiC), and the founding EiC in 2023.. He has been an IEEE Fellow since 1998. He served as an
        IEEE Communications Society Distinguished Lecturer in 2022-2023. He is serving a second term as the IEEE
        Communications Society Distinguished Lecturer in 2024-2025.
